# Camera_Projection

This is a project completed for CMPEN 454 at Penn State University. The goal of this project is to implement forward (3D point to 2D point) and inverse (2D point to 3D  ray) camera projection, and to  perform triangulation from two cameras to do 3D reconstruction from pairs of matching 2D image points.
